sizesel - size seletion: selection the dimention for the block partition
pest -get the approximated success probability
pestnorm - for the normal distributed lattice
sizesel2 - more efficient verision of sizesel, precomputation is needed
precomputation- preproduct of the r_ii and SP of Babai
roundtointerval - to compute the BER and VER
